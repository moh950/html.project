  Main articles: History of artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence
  Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's
  Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of
  artificial intelligence.
  The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led
  directly to Alan Turing's  
  theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate
  any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known
  as the Church–Turing thesis. Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to
  consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the
  question from whether a machine was intelligent, to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour"
  The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was
  McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons"
