  Main article: Machine learning
 
  Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception
   is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
   Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. Supervised
   learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to
   determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories
   Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs
   should change as the inputs change.
